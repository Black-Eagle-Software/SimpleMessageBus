##Credits/Acknowledgements
* MessageBus use with Unity idea from https://github.com/franciscotufro/message-bus-pattern
* MessageBus implementation similar to that found in [MVVM Light Framework Messenger class](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#GalaSoft.MvvmLight/GalaSoft.MvvmLight%20%28PCL%29/Messaging/Messenger.cs) (Not nearly as sophisticated though)
* WeakAction class similar to that found in [MVVM Light Framework](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#GalaSoft.MvvmLight/GalaSoft.MvvmLight%20%28PCL%29/Helpers/WeakAction.cs)
* Extension method to check if class implements interface from https://bradhe.wordpress.com/2010/07/27/how-to-tell-if-a-type-implements-an-interface-in-net/
